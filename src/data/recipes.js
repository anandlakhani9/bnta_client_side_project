      "instructions": "1) Peel and slice 1kg apples. \n 2) Mix 225g butter and 50g sugar in a large bowl. \n 3) Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the white for glazing later). Beat together for just under 1 min – it will look a bit like scrambled egg. \n 4) Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it’s beginning to clump up, then finish gathering it together with your hands. \n 5) Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 45 mins. Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar, the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later. \n 6) After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. Cut off a third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin – 20-22cm round and 4cm deep – leaving a slight overhang. \n 7) Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon-sugar mix. Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry-lined tin. \n 8) Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal. Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. (Can be frozen at this stage.) \n 9) Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle it with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 mins, until golden, then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. \n 10) Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream. \n 11) Beware - it’s a diabetes trap"

      "instructions": "1) Put the rhubarb in a saucepan and add the sugar, 75ml water and the liquid glucose. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod and add to the pan (with the pod) along with the star anise. \n 2) Place over a medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat slightly and cook for 15 mins until the sugar has dissolved and the fruit is soft and starting to break down. Remove from the heat and fish out the vanilla pod and star anise. Purée in a blender. \n 3) Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer, removing any remaining stringy bits of rhubarb. Transfer to a jug and stir in the lemon juice and vodka, if using. Cover and put in the fridge until fully chilled before churning in an ice cream machine, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scrape the sorbet into an airtight container and freeze for at least 3 hrs before serving. Will keep, frozen, for up to 1 month."
